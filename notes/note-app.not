any app in subprocess will use the parent dir as access

i.e.:
    a file structure:
        main.py
        disk
            usr
                pawan
                    app
                        some_file.txt
                        app1.sh
        file_1.txt

    
    in app1.sh:
        open("file_1.txt") will open the file
        open("disk/usr/pawan/app/some_file.txt") will open some_file.txt
